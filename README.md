# Shashank Mangal — Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a small, fast site built with React + Vite to showcase my work, skills, and the things I love building.

## About me 👋

Hi — I'm Shashank Mangal, a front-end developer who enjoys turning ideas into delightful, accessible interfaces. I focus on clean UI, smooth interactions, and readable code. When I'm not coding, you'll find me learning new web APIs, experimenting with animations, or working on a small creative side project.

Quick facts:
- Location: India 🇮🇳
- Role: Front-end Developer / UI Engineer
- Tools: React, Vite, CSS, small utilities and hooks
- Interests: performance, accessibility, CSS animations, design systems

Key features of this repo:
- Responsive layout that adapts to mobile and desktop
- Theme toggle (light/dark) with CSS variables
- Project gallery and individual project cards
- Small, component-driven structure for easy maintenance

## Tech stack 🛠️

- React
- Vite (dev server + build)
